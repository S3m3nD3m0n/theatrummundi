Words which *tell* rather than *describe* their subjects in the hands of a master render them featureless, so that they evoke *more* rather than *less* of what they are. Thus a stronger impression is made by virtue of it *being an impression,* which refuses to detail in a way whose definition would diminish its reality. Indeed so much of what is real today is false in just that reality and cannot be “shown” without disappearing. This is why talking about something, rather than treating it directly, strengthens what definition, at least for us, dissolves.
