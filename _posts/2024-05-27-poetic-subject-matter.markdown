The ordinary world of objects today is indescribable in its own terms: it consists almost entirely of branded objects without permanence, and which no human language can clarify. I can imagine the objection: was the advancement of modernism not precisely to expand the scope of legitimate poetic subjects? No. It is anachronistic to believe “contemporary subject-matter” is an advancement regardless of context.  One had recourse to the objects and situations of “modernising life” when poetic convention had been vitiated. What was “modern” was not contemporary because of its date, but because it was strong, because whatever is strong is young regardless of date (everyone knows the “news that stays news”). By the same token, what was outmoded was not outdated because it was old but because it no longer communicated anything forceful. Now it is the objects themselves that are vitiated: the whole fabric of life has become cheap, and even the most “advanced” developments appear senile, fragile, particular, and owned. The human scope of things has never been more banal; one must go either smaller, larger, or more abstract to find anything serious.
