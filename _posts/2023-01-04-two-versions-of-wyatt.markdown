It was once custom to write the older and irregular meters into the "stricter" standards of later prosodists. The following poem, Wyatt's <i>They Flee From Me,</i> is one such example. The first is the original, the second is Richard Tottel's emendation, from the 1557 <i>Miscellany</i>. Emendations are italicized.

They fle from me that sometyme did me seke <br>
With naked fote stalking in my chambre.<br>
I have sene theim gentill tame and meke<br>
That now are wyld and do not remembre<br>
That sometyme they put theimself in daunger<br>
To take bred at my hand; and nowe they raunge<br>
Besely seking with a continuell chaunge.<br>

Thancked be fortune, it hath bene othrewise<br>
Twenty tymes better; but ons in speciall,<br>
In thyn arraye after a pleasaunt gyse,<br>
When her lose gowne from her shoulders did fall,<br>
And she me caught in her armes long and small;<br>
Therewithall swetely did me kysse,<br>
And softely saide, dere hert, howe like you this? <br>

It was no dreme: I lay vrode waking. <br>
But all is torned thorough my gentilnes<br>
Into a straunge fasshion of forsaking;<br>
And I have leve to goo of her goodenes,<br>
And she also to vse new fangilnes.<br>
But syns that I so kyndely ame serued,<br>
I would fain knowe what she hath deserued.<br>

They flee from me, that somtime did me seke<br>
With naked fote stalkyng <i>within</i> my chamber.<br>
<i>Once haue I</i> seen them gentle, tame, and meke,<br>
That now are wild, and do not <i>once</i> remember<br>
That sometyme they <i>haue</i> put them selues in danger,<br>
To take bread at my hand, and now they range,<br>
Busily sekyng in continuall change. <br>

Thanked be Fortune, it hath bene otherwise<br>
Twenty tymes better: but once especiall,<br>
In thinne aray, after a pleasant gyse,<br>
When her loose gowne <i>did</i> from her shoulders fall<br>
And she me caught in her armes long and small,<br>
<i>And</i> therewithall, <i>so</i> swetely did me kysse,<br>
And softly sayd: deare heart, how like you this? <br>

It was no dreame: <i>for</i> I lay broad <i>awakyng</i>.<br>
But all is turnde <i>now through</i> my gentlenesse<br>
Into a <i>bitter</i> fashion of forsakyng:<br>
And I haue leaue to go of her goodnesse,<br>
and she also to vse newfanglenesse.<br>
But, sins that I <i>unkindly so</i> am serued:<br>
<i>How like you this,</i> what hath she <i>now</i> deserued?<br>

Every emendation in favour of "metre" is detrimental to the integrity of the composition. It is worth going over and comparing line by line. Whoever does so will understand the difference between metre as a rule and measure as the rhythmic integreity of a composition. 

The basic division which proportions Wyatt's phrase is the offset caesura. This is the initial quadrasylabic <i>colon</i> which opens almost every line. Whether it accepts one or two stresses (occaisonally more) is indifferent, as is the order of the "feet": what forms the rhythmn of the phrase is that stress or stresses are held ("sprung") in this truncated and disproprtioned introduction, and released in the following half. The first stanza may be scanned as follows:

They flé from me| that sómetýme did me séke <br>
With náked fóte| stálking in my chámbre.<br>
I have séne theim| géntill táme and méke<br>
That nów are wýld| and do not remémbre<br>
That sómetyme| they pút theimsélf in daúnger<br>
To take bréd at my hánd/; and nówe they raúnge<br>
Bésely séking| with a contínuell chaúnge.<br>

Above, each significant or held stress (what is practically a length) is accented; the straight divisions end the opening colon and the slanted division marks the caesura at its typical location. It is here more appropriate to speak of cola than feet, as the phrase is formed as a whole. Insensitively, one might say that within the colon the tendency is iambic; one might admit this if one had in mind an abstract stress metronome, and it is true that one could scan a good deal of the composition in this way, though Wyatt's "irregularities" often offset it. However, the rhythmically essential stresses are phrasal and have an almost quantitative force insofar as the tendency is to hold them in suspension, then release. Of these "stresses" there are normally four per line. Bunting claimed that the four beat line is, underneath the impositions of later prosodists, the normal articulation of the line in English, and I am inclined to agree. Here, one does not mean to say Wyatt's metre is quantitative, as quantity is not fixed in English and is dependant on stress; but that the major stresses of Wyatt's line are held, and are thus "stress quantities" and that the normal number of these per line is four, however proportioned or disproportioned by the caesura. More or less than four "stress quantities" per line is irregular. The dynamism of the English line is perhaps this four beat base, inherited from Old English, opperating in counterpoint or harmony with the impositions of later and foreign prosody.

Analogued with the breath, Wyatt's line is consistently a hurried inhalation, followed by a prolonged exhalation; and when this is excepted, it is a deliberate effect, as when the tense stuccato of the fifth line is relieved in the openning of the next, which consequently takes the "standard" caesural placement. It does so as a metrical inversion of fourth line: "That now are wyld" is recapitulated in "and now they raunge." The <i>force</i> of the mind's of lasp into reminiscence is realized as much by metre, and the order of rhythms, as by sense. Whether or not the effect is intended has no bearing on the fact that it is there and works; any sensibility of sufficient sensitivity will enjoy it whether or not he knows why. The caesura in the sixth line has "normal" placement because the typical division has been inverted; the typical division has been inverted to recall the reminiscing mind from past relief ("To take bred at my hand") to the contracted force of present reality ("and nowe they raunge"). Tottel does violence to this movement when he inserts "haue" into "That sometyme| they put theimself in daunger." "That sometymes" is more compressed colon than the rest, consisting of only three sylllables; the suspension is harder to hold; and the expansion that follows has the unusual intensity that follows vivid reminiscence totally vitiated by this awkwardly symetrical "haue." As Wyatt has it, what follows caesura is hard iambic sequence; it hangs on feminine ending, and laspes into gentleness ("To take bred at my hand"). Tottel's "improvement," though allowing more "regular" scansion, dissipates any force the iambic sequence might have. 

There is no regard for the integrated rhythms of Wyatt's phrase. These are the choices of a deaf man counting his fingers.
