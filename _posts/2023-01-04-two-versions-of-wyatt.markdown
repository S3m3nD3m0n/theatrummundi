It was once custom to write the older and irregular meters into the "stricter" standards of later prosodists. The following poem, Wyatt's <i>They Flee From Me,</i> is one such example. The first is the original, the second is Richard Tottel's emendation, from the 1557 <i>Miscellany</i>. Emendations are italicized.

They fle from me that sometyme did me seke <br>
With naked fote stalking in my chambre.<br>
I have sene theim gentill tame and meke<br>
That now are wyld and do not remembre<br>
That sometyme they put theimself in daunger<br>
To take bred at my hand; and nowe they raunge<br>
Besely seking with a continuell chaunge.<br>

Thancked be fortune, it hath be othrewise<br>
Twenty tymes better; but ons in speciall,<br>
In thyn arraye after a pleasaunt gyse,<br>
When her lose gowne from her shoulders did fall,<br>
And she me caught in her armes long and small;<br>
Therewithall swetely did she me kysse,<br>
And softely saide, dere hert, howe like you this? <br>

It was no dreme: I lay prode waking. <br>
But all is torned thorough my gentilnes<br>
Into a straunge gasshion of forsaking;<br>
And I have leve to goo of her goodenes,<br>
And she also to vse new fangilnes.<br>
But syns that I so kyndely ame serued,<br>
I would fain knowe what she hath deserued.<br>

They flee from me, that somtime did me seke<br>
With naked fote stalkyng <i>within</i> my chamber.<br>
<i>Once haue I</i> seen them gentle, tame, and meke,<br>
That now are wild, and do not <i>once</i> remember<br>
That sometyme they <i>haue</i> put them selues in danger,<br>
To take bread at my hand, and now they range,<br>
Busily sekyng in continuall change. <br>

Thanked be Fortune, it hath bene otherwise<br>
Twenty tymes better: but once especiall,<br>
In thinne aray, after a pleasant gyse,<br>
When her loose gowne <i>did</i> from her shoulders fall<br>
And she me caught in her armes long and small,<br>
<i>And</i> therewithall, <i>so</i> swetely did me kysse,<br>
And softly sayd: deare heart, how like you this? <br>

It was no dreame: <i>for</i> I lay broad <i>awakyng</i>.<br>
But all is turnde <i>now through</i> my gentlenesse<br>
Into a <i>bitter</i> fashion of forsakyng:<br>
And I haue leaue to go of her goodnesse,<br>
and she also to vse newfanglenesse.<br>
But, sins that I <i>unkindly so</i> am serued:<br>
<i>How like you this,</i> what hath she <i>now</i> deserued?<br>

Every emendation in favour of "metre" is detrimental to the integrity of the composition. It is worth going over and comparing line by line. Whoever does so will understand the difference between metre as a rule and measure as the rhythmic integreity of a composition. 

There is no regard for the integrated rhythms of Wyatt's phrase. These are the choices of a deaf man counting his fingers.
