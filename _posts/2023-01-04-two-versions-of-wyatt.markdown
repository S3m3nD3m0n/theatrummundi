It was once custom to write the older and irregular meters into the "stricter" standards of later prosodists. The following poem, Wyatt's <i>They Flee From Me,</i> is one such example. The first is the original, the second is Richard Tottel's emendation, from the 1557 <i>Miscellany</i>. Emendations are italicized.

Every emendation in favour of "metre" is detrimental to the integrity of the composition. It is worth going over and comparing line by line. Whoever does so will understand the difference between metre as a rule and measure as the rhythmic integreity of a composition. 

The basic division which proportions Wyatt's phrase is the offset caesura. This is the initial quadrasyllabic <i>colon</i> which opens almost every line. Whether it accepts one or two stresses (occaisonally more) is mostly indifferent, as is the order of the "feet": what forms the rhythmn of the phrase is that stress or stresses are held (speaking with Hopkins, "sprung") in this truncated and disproprtioned introduction, and released in the following half. The first stanza may be scanned as follows:

They flé from me| that sómetyme díd me séke <br>
With náked fóte| stálking in my chámbre.<br>
Í have séne theim| géntill táme and méke<br>
That nów are wýld| and do not remémbre<br>
That sómetyme| they pút theimsélf in daúnger<br>
To take bréd at my hánd/; and nówe they raúnge<br>
Bésely séking| with a contínuell chaúnge.<br>

Above, each significant or held stress (what is practically a length) is accented; the straight divisions end the opening colon and the slanted division marks the caesura at its typical location. It is here more appropriate to speak of cola than feet, as the phrase is formed as a varible whole. Insensitively, but not altogether falsely, one might say that within the colon the tendency is iambic; one might admit this if one had in mind an abstract stress metronome, and it is true that one could scan a good deal of the composition in this way, though Wyatt's "irregularities" often offset it. However, considering these cola in terms of feet neglects the actual articulation of Wyatt's phrase. Almost as many cola can be scanned iambically as not, and more if one is actually listening to the articulate stress. These rhythmically essential stresses are phrasal and have an almost <i>quantitative</i> force insofar as the tendency is to hold them in suspension, then release. Of these stresses there are normally four per line. Bunting claimed that the four beat line is, underneath the impositions of later prosodists, the normal articulation of the line in English, and I am inclined to agree. Here, one does not mean to imply Wyatt's measure is quantitative, as quantity is not fixed in English and is dependant on stress; but that the major stresses of Wyatt's line are <i>held</i>, and are thus articulated as "stress quantities" and that the normal number of these per line is four, however proportioned or disproportioned by the caesura. More or less than four "stress quantities" per line is irregular. The dynamism of the English line is perhaps this four beat base, inherited from Old English, operating in counterpoint or harmony with the impositions of later and foreign prosody.

Analogued with the breath, Wyatt's line is consistently a hurried inhalation, followed by a prolonged exhalation; and when this is excepted, it is a deliberate effect, as when the tense stuccato of the fifth line is relieved in the openning of the next, which consequently takes the "standard" caesural placement. It does so as a metrical inversion of fourth line: "That now are wyld" is recapitulated in "and now they raunge." The force of the mind's lasp into reminiscence is realized as much by metre, and the order of rhythms, as by sense. Whether or not the effect is intended has no bearing on the fact that it is there and works; any sensibility of sufficient sensitivity will enjoy it whether or not he knows why. 

<span style="color: #bb0100;">That nów are wýld</span>| and do not remémbre <br>
That sómetyme| they pút theimsélf in daúnger <br>
To take bréd at my hánd/; <span style="color: #bb0100;">and nówe they raúnge</span> <br>

The caesura in the sixth line has "normal" placement because the typical division has been inverted; the typical division has been inverted to recall the reminiscing mind from past relief ("To take bred at my hand") to the contracted force of present reality ("and nowe they raunge"). Tottel does violence to this movement when he inserts "haue" into "That sometyme they put theimself in daunger." "That sometyme," a three syllable colon, is a more compressed; the suspension, bridged by two relatively weak stresses, is harder to hold; and the expansion that follows has the unusual intensity that follows vivid reminiscence totally vitiated by Tottel's awkward symmetry. The line wants to stumble into strength. As Wyatt has it, what follows caesura is hard iambic sequence; it hangs on feminine ending, and laspses into gentleness ("To take bred at my hand"). Tottel's "improvement," though allowing more "regular" scansion, dissipates any force the iambic sequence might have. 

There is no regard for the integrated rhythms of Wyatt's phrase. These are the choices of a deaf man counting his fingers.
