Poetry is artifice; the matter of *quality* rests on whether the nature involved in that artifice holds up *as nature*, i.e. holds up out of the nature of its parts, or *merely by outward force.* “Formalism,” as perjorative, means: composition held together by *extrinsic force.* “Form,” as compliment, means: composition held together by *intrinsic force,* as ρυθμός (meaning: not “flow” but <i>composure</i>). Or: “formalism” means <i>posture</i>, “form” <i>composure</i>. Moreover, there is a composure, and hence rhythm, not just of sound, but also of sense. From this it follows that the poet has his proximity to music not as a second-rate musician with the misfortune of being corrupted by the word, but as a <i>composer</i>, in his own right, as is understood by the word “poet” (ποιητής). Our distance from the Greeks is measured by who merits the name “composer.”
