*Verse, fame, and beauty are intense indeed,* <br>
*But death's intenser-Death is Life's high meed.* <br>

Keats' fantasy is real, or struggles to be real, through intensity. He must agglutinate sensuality on sensuality to charge it with an intensity which would parallel the intensity of the real, and display their common texture. He will always be weaker, and yet his point is proven: they are made of the same ultimate stuff, differing only in the species of their endurance. This is the *strenuous tongue* which *can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine.* *Sweetness* is the fruit of this strength, which is the strength of the intensly real.

We may just as well substitute *appearance is reality, reality appearance* for Keats' *beauty* and *truth*. He is least of all an advocate for the distinction between *art* and *life*.

At his worst, his sensuality is laid on so thick, with desperation so obvious, that the effect is weakened, and becomes tasteless instead of sickening.

Keats' *no* is an opportunity to elaborate what is. Recall the sonnet *To Leigh Hunt, Esq.* *No* glorifies what is not; *no* forgets itself, and permits what is not to process until the disjunction recalls non-being and new-being. Cf. also *What the Thrush Said.*

Essential words: *sweet, still, ripe, love.*

Each poet has his names, which speak the singular force which composes both the world and his words. For these he is responsible, and, in their charge, made their custodian. They are that which his art is for, and therefore his ethic.
