The meaning and potential truth of a text are not identical unless the text is sacred. Writing might speak truth despite the best intentions of its author. But it is the effect of divine authorship which assimilates meaning wholly into truth. Scripture therefore more properly names a method of reading than of writing. The particular author is erased, and in his absence what is true is meant.
