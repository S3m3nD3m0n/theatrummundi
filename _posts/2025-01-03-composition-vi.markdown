I have attempted on and off for several years to make this composition work, and this is its latest state, likely to be subject to further revision, although found satisfying enough for now to be seen by the handful of people who will see it. 

What was the dream which was its reason <br>
Is long in waiting satisfaction. Yes, <br>
It was and was not felt to be returned: <br>
This love, which burled about your breast as smoke <br>

In alabaster. No beauty, which spared <br>
So little, so reproached us then as now <br>
In witness. The dream you said will be the <br>
White of ivory is blind and blinding, <br>
As hoarfrost wrings its candour from the bone. <br>
