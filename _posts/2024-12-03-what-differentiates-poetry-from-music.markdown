Music has forever been the image of indifference. But to assume as accomplished fact that indifference which is only ever factual as an ideal is to make prematurely slack what should exist as tension. When Pater says “strive,” someone else reads “becomes,” and overweights the goal against the starting-place, i.e. gives in to the image of music as a fact. But verse is strong only as much as it holds its composure in this tension, between the difference of form and content in fact and their ideal indifference as music, and binds itself to the mast: and this middle, which is in fact the end of composition, is the source of its distinction.
