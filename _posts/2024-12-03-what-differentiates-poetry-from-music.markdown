Music has forever been the common image of indifference. But to assume, as accomplished fact, that indifference which is only ever *factual as an ideal* is to make prematurely slack what should exist as tension. When Pater says “strive,” someone else reads “should become,” and overweights the dream against the nature of the dreamer. The *image* of music is given into as a *fact.* But verse is strong only as much as it holds its composure in this tension, between the *difference of form and content in fact* and their *ideal indifference as music*, and binds itself to the mast: and this middle, which is in fact the end of composition, is the source of its distinction.
