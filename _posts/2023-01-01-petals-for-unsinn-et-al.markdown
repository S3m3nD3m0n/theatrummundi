§1 The only justification of work is to prove that no such justification is necessary. The effect is love. 

§2 Beauty, which is a definite effect despite its featurings, like all loves is singular and of one singular, unjustifiably real, lost to distraction. It concludes everything which is not itself.

§3 The poet creates words for which words are insufficient.

§4 Like all things sufficient to themselves, the conclusion of the poem encourages what it refuses, what is more than enough.

§5 On lovers and commentators: beauty appears in the features of things, but not as them, and is confused for them only by the desperate or garrulous. 

§6 We realize, in the accomplished work, the world’s willingness to be.

§7 The good may be both an aberation and the ultimate rule.

§8 “Art” is now more excuse than fact.

§9 Imagination, being weaker in fact and stronger in range than fact, knows more intimately the nothing which threatens all fact with illusion.

§10 The work proves reality intensity; thus fiction outworks nature by its nature. 

§11 “Naturalism” has never not deceived from impotence. 

§12 Nothing seperates the mere act from action but itself. 

§13 To charge language with the force of what it names is the responsiblity of diction.

§14 In winter appears only the hard edge of things.

§15 Illusion is the least philosphic of dismissals. 

§16 Beauty is where the real begins to abstract itself.

§17 The effect of an ordinary person today is as jarring againtst a city like Venice as the same in nature. We used to, and still do in translated forms, speak of nature and culture; and the old culture has become new nature as it fosilized.
