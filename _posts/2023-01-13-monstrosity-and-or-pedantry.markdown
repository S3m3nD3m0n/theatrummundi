<i>Monstrosity (monstrositas) which is done against the course of nature</i>, Thomas Blount's Glossographia

There is no nature which the imposition of force can alter. Therefore, nature, understood as for so long, as substantial, belonging to the integrity of <i>things</i>, no longer holds, or must needs be (has been) subject to redefinition: e.g., the smallest possible unit of decomposition and the forces which govern it. The higher order is fungible, from the position of force, unnatural; but from the position of weakness, of things as we now know them, this fungibility is monstrous, as there is seemly nothing that, under the imposition of suffient force, cannot be made another. Nature, in the old sense, no longer, or increasingly hardly, restrains action; and the good taste of nature, which was the gift of strength to restrained weakness, cannot not be disregarded faced with such opportunity, but where not is strength in deliberate debility. 

Death retains its significance as the last garauntee of nature, i.e. what in itself cannot be decomposed by force. Even if indefinitely postponed, it remains inviolate: it is that against which nature is.
