I have changed the last stanza almost totally. As it whole it now reads:


There is no question, full enough, <br>
of its movement, time enough <br> 
to suspend that suspension, breathe what <br>
dense, and through its density, <br>

palpable air gives at last: <br>
inhilation, a false note of fall <br>
in winter, collects itself. <br>
I carry out my double. <br>

The final stanza originally read:

palpable air gives at last: inhalation; <br>
a fault laid in the feathered <br>
breast; an inevitable avoidable failure. <br>

I am not entirely satisfied with this but want to leave it up for the record.
