I have changed the last stanza almost totally. As it whole it now reads:


There is no question, full enough,
of its movement, time enough
to suspend that suspension, breathe what
dense, and through its density,

palpable air gives at last:
inhilation, a false note of fall
in winter, collects itself.
I carry out my double. 

The final stanza originally read:

palpable air gives at last: inhalation;
a fault laid in the feathered 
breast; an inevitable avoidable failure.

I am not entirely satisfied with this but want to leave it up for the record.
