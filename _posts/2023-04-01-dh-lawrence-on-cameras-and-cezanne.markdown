<i> From Art and Morality </i>

Because of a very curious habit that civilised man has been forming down the whole course of civilisation, and in which he is now hardboiled. The slowly-formed habit of seeing just as the photographic camera sees.

But you may say that the object reflected on the retina is always photographic. It may be. I doubt it. But whatever the image on the retina may be, it is rarely, even now, the photographic image of the object which is actually taken in by the man who sees the object. He does not, even now, see for himself. He sees what the kodak has taught him to see. And man, try as he may, is not a kodak.

...

This is the habit we have formed: of visualizing everything. Each man to himself is a picture. That is, he is a complete little objective reality, complete in himself, existing by himself, absolutely, in the middle of the picture. All the rest is just setting, background. To every man, to every woman, the universe is just a setting to the absolute little picture of himself, or herself. This has been the development of the conscious ego in man through several thousand years: since the Greek artists first broke the spell of "darkness". Man has learnt to see himself. So now, he is what he sees. He makes himself in his own image. Previously, even in Egypt, men had not learned to see straight. They fumbled in the dark, and didn't quite know where they were, or what they were. Like men in a dark room, they only felt their own existence surging in the darkness of other existences.

We, however, have learned to see ourselves for what we are, as the sun sees us. The kodak bears witness. We see as the All-Seeing Eye sees, with the universal vision. And we are what is seen; each man to himself an identity, an isolated absolute, corresponding with a universe of isolated absolutes. A picture! A kodak snap, in a universal film of snaps. The picture, of rue, the me that is seen, is me. 

As soon as we are supremely satisfied about it, somebody starts to upset us. Comes Cezanne with his pitcher and his apples, which are not only not life-like, but are a living lie. The kodak will prove that they are a lie.

The All-Seeing Eye sees with every degree of intensity and in every possible kind of mood; Giotto, Titian, El Greco, Turner, all so different, yet all the true image in the All-Seeing Eye.

This Cezanne still-life, however, is contrary to the All-Seeing Eye. Apples, to the eye of God, could not look like that, nor could a tablecloth, nor could a pitcher. So, it is wrong.

And if apples don't look like that, in any light or circumstance, or under any mood, then they shouldn't be painted like that. "Oh, la-la-la! The apples are just like that, to me," cries Cezanne. "They are like that, no matter what they look like to the kodak. Sometimes they're a sin, sometimes they're a knock on the head, sometimes they're a bellyache, sometimes they're part of a pie, sometimes they're sauce for the goose. And you can't see a bellyache, neither can you see a sin, neither can you see a knock on the head. So, paint the apple in these aspects, and you getâ€”probably, or approximately, a still-life by me."

And this is the immortality in Cezanne: he begins to see more than the All-Seeing Eye of humanity can possibly see, kodak-wise. If you can see in the apple a bellyache and a knock on the head, and paint these in the image, along with its prettiness, then it is the death of the kodak and the movies, and so must be immoral.

The true artist doesn't substitute immorality for morality. On the contrary, he always substitutes a finer morality for a grosser. And as soon as you see a finer morality, the grosser becomes relatively immoral.
