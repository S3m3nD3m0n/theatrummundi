The ideas of Constellation (in critical theory), Atlas (in art history), and Vortex (in poetry) are explications of relations implicitly collected in the matters they associate, just as the earth, before excavation, already contains the matters which the archeologist and curator have arranged for display. The Constellation and the Atlas, belonging to scientific disciplines, are secondary means of association. The Vortex, on the other hand, is a means of associating elements often, but not exclusively, of the same kind as their result, i.e. a poetic work including poetic work, but not therefore (and by contrast) an anthology. On the level of method, the Vortex is secondary, dealing for the most part with other matters, and, through the course of development, treats even its own past contents secondarily, as motifs or themes reorganised. The result of such associations, on the other hand, is a work in its own right and therefore primary. But the integrity of associated elements is not to be confused for the integrity of the things associated. The opposite can be asserted to make the same point: there is no poetic work which is not already composed of citations (whether or not these are citations from literature, or the common fabric of language in general; language is common, hence communicative, and exists as every instance of its use). The Vortex, as a method of composition, and abstracted from musical analogy, makes such a fact explicit, first in itself, but as a consequence also in the citations it associates. What is implicit in a work, which, under normal circumstances, seamlessly articulates its citations within its own integrity, is here left explicitly incoherent.
