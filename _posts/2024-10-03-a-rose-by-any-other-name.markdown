A rose by any other name would not smell as sweet, as all roses hereafter are sweetened by association with the "rose" of this line. The *success* of this line, as a habit now lodged within the collective memory of the English language, *falsifies* it: it is a banality about the failure of language in which language succeeds. The line is *expressive* because of this irony, and ironic because it manages to be *expressive.* This is the irony which governs the action of the play as a whole.
