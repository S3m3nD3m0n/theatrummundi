It is much easier to *hear* the relations between notes in a fugue than it is to *understand* the relations between images and anecdotes. The fugue analogy cannot work; the structural relations of a fugue are *internal*, whereas the relation and meaning of historical anecdotes, granting the reader familiar with their referent, are *external*, residing mostly in the mind of the author. The mind does not *perceive* as the ear; nor are the ear and the eye analogous.
