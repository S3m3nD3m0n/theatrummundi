At my least charitable, the writing is so at odds with itself the stakes are no longer visible; it is narcissus bent on beating his image back into the water. Complicity recognised is not absolution, and so the task of recognition, each act being as insufficient as what it follows, is infinite. This is an attitude, an involution, which is determined, as a matter of conviction, to never get over itself, moral self-involvement or vainglory; in an image, it is the negative of a renaissance Prince painting himself into humble audience with the Virgin and Child in his private chapel. You are not as complicit as it flatters you to believe. You are, fortunately in fact and unfortunately for you, condemned to innocence, or the common guilts indistinguishable from such.
