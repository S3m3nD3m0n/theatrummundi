"Drama presents the life process in itself. It does so...in the sense that it recalls for us the alarming relation in which the individual, who has been discharged from the original nexus, stands opposed to the whole of which he still remains a part, despite his inconceivable freedom."

"Art...was able to dissolve isolation again and again through the excess implanted in isolation itself and to free the idea from its defective form. Guilt lies in excess. The isolated one is excessive only because he, as imperfect, has no claim to permanence and thus must work toward his own <i>destruction</i>. Therefore, reconciliation also lies in excess, insofar as one can ask for reconciliation in the realm of art. This guilt is an absolutely original one that cannot be seperated from the concept of man and scarecely falls into his consciousness. It is posited with life itself."
