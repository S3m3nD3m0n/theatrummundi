It is a presumption of commercial translation that every language has the resources at its disposal to translate any other; for instance, that Homer can be translated into contemporary English effectively, or Sophocles. Both “literal” equivalence and “naturalising” equivalence are rather equivalences of habit than sense or force: what one would say in like context, but without the broader nexus of association which, lending words their weight, decides in favour of one use against another.

A person forced to work with certain materials develops a sensitivity to their qualities as effects. But what is at stake in a choice of style, which is not a “superficial” concern, but is the real substance of sense in its most precise, and hence unparaphrasable form, is not the habit of a particular syntactic context (here is how I would ask for bread in Swahili, here in German) but rather the whole history of a word in use, whether recalled explicitly or by the unconscious strata of the language itself. This specificity of effect, the level at which sense is a matter of sensation, is at odds with other understandings of “sense,” which consider precision a matter of decontextualisation, distillation from the sensory rather than its expression, which is not concerned with what is lost through paraphrase, and produces a legible “form” separable from “content.” It takes the specific effect of mathematics as a language to be the rule of sense in general. But, as a few have already recognised, “natural language” does not approach the purity of mathematical effect by being vitiated and decomposed into “prose.”
